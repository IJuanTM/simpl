## Icons

### Description

This add-on contains the main free Font Awesome icons for easy usage in your Simpl project. I only included the important ones in css format using the font-face method. For more information about the icons, please visit the [Font Awesome website](http://fontawesome.io/icons).

### Installation

1. Copy the `public` folder to your Simpl project's folder
2. Add the Font Awesome stylesheet links from the `views/parts/css.phtml` file to your project's `views/parts/css.phtml` file, underneath the font stylesheet link
