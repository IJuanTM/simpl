## Add-ons

#### About

Add-ons are extensions to the Simpl framework. They can be very simple and only a couple of lines of code, to complex and larger systems that add a lot of functionality to the framework. I will add more add-ons to Simpl as I create them for my own projects, so that they can be used by others. If you have an idea for an add-on, or made one yourself, please let me know and I will look into adding it to the framework.

#### Add-ons
